# MiniProjects
Small Projects Outside of school I feel inspired to create whenever I learn something new that interests me.

The First Project in here is a C++ project I did on matrices.  It is pretty simple and I wanted to expand my knowlege on functions that use pointers and references.
 - The user is prompted to enter a number of matricies and then the length and width of each matrix
 - The user is then told to enter values for each index in the matrix
 - Each Matrix is printed and then the sum of all Matricies is also printed
 - I really enjoyed this project because not only did I learn a lot but I feel like there is some real life applications for this
 - Something I might consider adding in the future is a function to compare the similarites of the matrix's with a dot plot

The Second Project in here is a C++ project me and my friend Dononvan Francis (dfrancis07) did on recursion to create a register.
 - The user is prompted to enter a number without a decimal (For example:  for $27.43 you enter 2743)
 - The program will output the most efficient way to get to that value usings dollars and change
 - Something I might consider adding in the future is a change converision from USD to other forms of currency
