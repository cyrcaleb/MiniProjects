# MiniProjects
Small Projects Outside of school I feel inspired to create whenever I learn something new that interests me.


The First Project (addMatrix.cpp) in here is a C++ project I did on matrices.  It is pretty simple and I wanted to expand my knowlege on functions that use pointers and references.
 - The user is prompted to enter a number of matricies and then the length and width of each matrix
 - The user is then told to enter values for each index in the matrix
 - Each Matrix is printed and then the sum of all Matricies is also printed
 - I really enjoyed this project because not only did I learn a lot but I feel like there is some real life applications for this
 - Something I might consider adding in the future is a function to compare the similarites of the matrix's with a dot plot


The Second Project (register.cpp) in here is a C++ project me and my friend Dononvan Francis (dfrancis07) did on recursion to create a register.
 - The user is prompted to enter a number without a decimal (For example:  for $27.43 you enter 2743)
 - The program will output the most efficient way to get to that value usings dollars and change
 - Something I might consider adding in the future is a change converision from USD to other forms of currency
 
 
The Third Project (changePermutations.cpp) in here is a C++ project similar to the second project register that gives the user ALL the possible permutations to get to coin amounts less than $1.00.  
 - The user is prompted to enter a number without a decimal (For example:  for $0.07 you enter 7)
 - Something to note about this project is that the permutations grow exponentially fast so unless you want to sit there for a few minutes, select numbers < 35
 - The program will output all possible coin permutations and the order in which the coins are picked along with the total number of permutations
 - I purposely chose to do permutations and not combinations in order to show that althought the coin outputs are the same, the order in which they are chose are not
 - Something I might consider adding in the future is making this project visual by showing actualy images of the coins instead of just printing their names.
